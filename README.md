How to play:

  The program selects the number around which all actions will take place.
  
  Next, she chooses a number to compare in the range of numbers being played.
  
  Next, you choose at your discretion whether the number that you have made up is greater or less than the one with which you were offered to compare. For example, if the main number is 626, and you compare it with 430 and you think that the main number is greater than yours, then you write "up", if less, then "down", respectively.
  
  If you think you know what the number is, then just write it in the input field
